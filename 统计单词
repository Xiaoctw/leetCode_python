Christmas or Christmas Day is a holiday
 celebrating the birth of Jesus, the central figure
 of Christianity. It is traditionally celebrated on December
  25 by most Western Christian churches. Although dating to probably
   as early as a.d. 200, the feast of Christmas did not become widespread until
    the Middle Ages. Aspects of celebration may include gift-giving, Christmas trees,
    display of Nativity sets, church attendance, the Father Christmas/Santa Claus myth,
     and family gatherings. The word Christmas is derived from Middle
      English Christemasse.
      It is a contraction meaning "Christ's mass". The name of the holiday is often shortened to
 Xmas because Roman letter "X" resembles the Greek letter X, an
 abbreviation for Christ.
